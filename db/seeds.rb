His main concern was the possibility of fraud in the origination of loans that could freeze the market if it were to approach 20%.</p><p>Mehta reiterated that improved operational capabilities would secure the future of the industry.</p></noscript></div></div>

eulendingusa15 = Video.create(title: 'The European Online Lending Opportunity', description: 'The European Online Lending Opportunity at LendIt USA 2015, with James Meekings, Chief Commercial Officer & Co-Founder of Funding Circle; Peter Behrens, Co-Founder & Chief Commercial Officer of RateSetter; Geoff Miller, CEO of GLI Finance; Jaidev Janardana, COO of Zopa; Partel Tomberg, Founder & CEO of Bondora; Etienne Boillot, CEO & Co-Founder of Eiffel eCapital; and moderator Cormac Leech, Equity Research at Liberum.<br><br>Moderator Cormac Leech summed up the goals and rules of engagement for this panel; The questions would probe important issues in European marketplace lending and for that reason would often be thorny. The first question on trajectory went to Partel Tomberg, Bondora. This panelist made bold statements concerning the implicit stability his heavily unsecured lending received by diversifying into multiple countries.<br><br>The moderator then pointed questions on provision funds to Peter Behrens. James Meekings pointed out the general trend in marketplace lending of institutional capital entering in to the alternative finance and marketplace lending arena. This ought to be a stabilizing factor or a spur to higher standards. He further pointed out that the first 3 months of 2015 have seen more alt fi issuance than in all of 2013.<br><br>The moderator followed up with a comparison between the industry in Europe. Boillot pointed out that the UK is 3 times ahead of the US, but continental Europe is way behind with 50% less penetration. Geoff thinks part of the reason is a lack of regulatory framework. While the vast majority of the funding is retail funding, the UK regulations seemed to be more open to institutional investors.<br><br>Several panelists and the moderator pointed out the relatively light regulation on the industry compared to banks, not just in mainland Europe where almost all business lending is from banks, but also in the UK and US.

The first question on trajectory went to Partel Tomberg, Bondora. This panelist made bold statements concerning the implicit stability his heavily unsecured lending received by diversifying into multiple countries.</p><p>The moderator then pointed questions on provision funds to Peter Behrens. James Meekings pointed out the general trend in marketplace lending of institutional capital entering in to the alternative finance and marketplace lending arena. This ought to be a stabilizing factor or a spur to higher standards. He further pointed out that the first 3 months of 2015 have seen more alt fi issuance than in all of 2013.</p><p>The moderator followed up with a comparison between the industry in Europe. Boillot pointed out that the UK is 3 times ahead of the US, but continental Europe is way behind with 50% less penetration. Geoff thinks part of the reason is a lack of regulatory framework. While the vast majority of the funding is retail funding, the UK regulations seemed to be more open to institutional investors.</p><p>Several panelists and the moderator pointed out the relatively light regulation on the industry compared to banks, not just in mainland Europe where almost all business lending is from banks, but also in the UK and US. Geoff Miller of GLI Finance stated, “If online lending brought down rates significantly, the risk adjusted returns and regulation would increase in tandem.”</p><p>When these panelists from the European industry thought about the industry in America, Etienne Boillot replied, “European investors are very interested in US p2p.” The moderator, Mr. Boillot and Miller agreed risk adjusted returns in Europe seem to be a bit lower in Europe than in the US and that getting institutional investors to invest across borders was key.

gibbusa15 = Video.create(title: 'Fireside Chat with Gregg Gibb & Jason Jones', description: 'A fireside Chat with Gregg Gibb, Chairman &amp; CEO of Lufax, and Jason Jones, Co-Founder &amp; Partner at Lend Academy, at LendIt USA 2015.<br><br>Lufax is a 3 year old company and has originated $2.5 billion last year from their platform. Half of their business is connecting lenders and buyers. This includes loans for cars, small businesses etc.  The other half of the business is securitization. Lufax securitizes and resells loans to retail investors.<br><br>Lufax’s philosophy is that there are assets and investors. Their platform is a way to give better risk adjusted returns to hungry Chinese investors as well as credit to borrowers. The population in China tends to save more at a younger age, meaning that those with spare capital are more tech savvy than their older, yet similarly investment seeking US counterparts. This is a factor in the popularity of seamless online p2p lending in China.<br><br>There are other differences beyond the relative youth of Chinese investors. Regulations and SOE banks constrain returns and also prevent any institutions from lending to individuals.  In China, if you are a company lending, then you are a bank. But in the US, you can be lent as an institution and not be a borrower. In the online p2p lending world in the US, three quarters of money comes from institutional investors. For Lufax, it is very fractured with 100% being retail investors.<br><br>Lufax is linked directly to the Chinese Credit Bureaus. They use alternative methods to underwrite, such as driving safety records to evaluate how safe it is to lend to a driver.

Half of their business is connecting lenders and buyers. This includes loans for cars, small businesses etc. The other half of the business is securitization. Lufax securitizes and resells loans to retail investors.</p><p>Lufax’s philosophy is that there are assets and investors. Their platform is a way to give better risk adjusted returns to hungry Chinese investors as well as credit to borrowers. The population in China tends to save more at a younger age, meaning that those with spare capital are more tech savvy than their older, yet similarly investment seeking US counterparts. This is a factor in the popularity of seamless online p2p lending in China.</p><p>There are other differences beyond the relative youth of Chinese investors. Regulations and SOE banks constrain returns and also prevent any institutions from lending to individuals. In China, if you are a company lending, then you are a bank. But in the US, you can be lent as an institution and not be a borrower. In the online p2p lending world in the US, three quarters of money comes from institutional investors. For Lufax, it is very fractured with 100% being retail investors.</p><p>Lufax is linked directly to the Chinese Credit Bureaus. They use alternative methods to underwrite, such as driving safety records to evaluate how safe it is to lend to a driver. It also seems better to lend to women or someone who has had 1 phone number for more than 2 years.</p><p>One of the main factors in the initial growth of Lufax was their partnership with Ping An, (founded in 1988) which is the largest non-state owned lender in China. Gregg Gibb states that the Chinese p2p and securitization lending market will grow 30x in the next few years.</p></noscript></div></div>

Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, filled the Broadway Ballroom with his big hope about the future of finance, based on the size of the LendIt USA 2015 conference.<br><br>After playing a key role in every financial crisis in the last two decades (at least) it\'s safe to say Summers knows what he\'s talking about when he declares it\'s high time for the renewal of the financial system.<br><br>He lamented the failure of mainstream banking to stimulate growth by encouraging investment, not saving, thereby putting itself at risk, counter to its fundamental purpose.<br><br>And Summers has been a key player in encouraging the online marketplace, not least by sitting on the boards of industry mavens Lending Club and Square.<br><br>It is inspiring to see a man with this pedigree evangelising the power of new technology, especially to "do new things rather than to do old things better". He recalled that it was President Clinton who sowed the seed of internet innovation with his ‘presumption of permission’ paradigm in the mid-90s (when the web was but an acorn).<br><br>He told the Lendit delegates that everybody is a stakeholder in the success of the financial system and emphasised the need for transparency and disclosure, so that consumers decide with informed choice.<br><br>In addition Summers called for a level playing field for the new world of finance, with the newcomers on the same footing as incumbents; and he acknowledged the need for workable regulatory frameworks.', track: 'Main', slug: 'signature-keynote-lawrence-summers', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/ed70771643c4969b3507c6d1c1ef52f8d9e731fd.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_aovhf2fzjk" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="LendIt USA 2015: Signature Keynote by Lawrence H.

Half of the jobs in our country come from the 23 million small businesses. Of those, only 5 million have employees.<br><br>These small businesses, like all those who are credit dependent, were dispraportionately affected by the financial crisis. 60% of job losses post 2008 came from small business. Karen then discussed the post 08 decision with Larry Summers to guarantee up to 90% of SBA bank loans. The 90% guarantee helped a lot but there was no good data to figure out how big the need was. Data on loan origination is set to come from Dodd Frank.<br><br>Small community banks do 40% of the small business loans. Pre 08 there were 14 thousand of these, now there are 7 thousand. Even banks that are lending to small business, who say they are lending to everyone who are creditworthy are not issuing the loans small businesses need.<br><br>70% of small businesses want loans that are for less than 250k. This is the large gap in the market opportunity. Online lending has stepped to fill a lot of this gap. Karen Mills then answered several questions surrounding capital, growth, regulation and components of the industry.', track: 'Main', slug: 'mills-state-small-business', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/ea4da2ee583a26443f7a4c3cfe4f875a077093d1.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_tr8g8oboa0" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="LendIt USA 2015: Special Presentation: Karen Gordon Mills" /><meta itemprop="duration" content="PT26M48S" /><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/ea4da2ee583a26443f7a4c3cfe4f875a077093d1.bin" /><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b55f8838131c987f72280f3d443bb634d44644f4.bin" /><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27&autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=521514265&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F35183d916291043883b637776130f74576ff0c85.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1608.84&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fea4da2ee583a26443f7a4c3cfe4f875a077093d1.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb55f8838131c987f72280f3d443bb634d44644f4.bin" /><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2015-05-05T19:44:33Z" /><object id="wistia_tr8g8oboa0_seo" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" style="display:block;height:546px;position:relative;width:970px;"><param name="movie" value="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=521514265&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F35183d916291043883b637776130f74576ff0c85.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1608.84&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fea4da2ee583a26443f7a4c3cfe4f875a077093d1.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb55f8838131c987f72280f3d443bb634d44644f4.bin"></param><embed src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor=#000000 flashvars="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=521514265&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F35183d916291043883b637776130f74576ff0c85.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1608.84&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fea4da2ee583a26443f7a4c3cfe4f875a077093d1.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb55f8838131c987f72280f3d443bb634d44644f4.bin" name="wistia_tr8g8oboa0_html" style="display:block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="opaque"></embed></object><noscript itemprop="description"><p>Special Presentation on The State of Small Business by Karen Gordon Mills, Former Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, at LendIt USA 2015.</p><p><a href="http://blog.lendit.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Karen.Mills-LendIt-Small-Business-Lending.pdf">View and download the slides here.</a></p><p><a href="http://www.lendit.co/usa/2015">LendIt USA</a>is the world’s largest annual gathering of the online lending community.

CAN described the continual raising of the bar as more mature players in finance enter the marketplace, suggesting “an omni-channel approach to surrounding small businesses with smart messaging”.<br><br>Kabbage founder Kathryn Petralia is well prepared for more institutional scrutiny, as they are already subject to regulations via one of their banking partners and are investigating additional sources of capital.<br><br>Steve Alloca of Paypal said that their data sources had not yet been tested by this credit cycle and they would not seek growth for growth’s sake, but focus on access to capital and combatting fraud. Square executive Anton Hanebrink cited the critical need for transparency and to be able to adjust quickly, something which enabled them to advance $100M in their first year of operation.<br><br>Technology will continue to drive the sector, in the view of Merchant Cash & Capital founder Stephen Sheinbaum, and institutional monitoring can only enhance validation, so that it will be difficult for the traditional lenders to recapture the market from the digital lending pioneers.', track: 'Main', slug: 'usa15-short-term-small-business-lending', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d09901147a6d021896df6b47340b2c04330fbecb.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_ugs3g2vurn" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="LendIt USA 2015: Short Term Small Business Lending" /><meta itemprop="duration" content="PT40M12S" /><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d09901147a6d021896df6b47340b2c04330fbecb.bin" /><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/2353b213d0de78bc59d7af8d098331812e8a0019.bin" /><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27&autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=795636217&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F601c4814b3957342164b6635b6f86f86ec21d534.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2412.04&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fd09901147a6d021896df6b47340b2c04330fbecb.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F2353b213d0de78bc59d7af8d098331812e8a0019.bin" /><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2015-06-08T20:09:24Z" /><object id="wistia_ugs3g2vurn_seo" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" style="display:block;height:546px;position:relative;width:970px;"><param name="movie" value="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=795636217&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F601c4814b3957342164b6635b6f86f86ec21d534.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2412.04&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fd09901147a6d021896df6b47340b2c04330fbecb.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F2353b213d0de78bc59d7af8d098331812e8a0019.bin"></param><embed src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor=#000000 flashvars="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=795636217&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F601c4814b3957342164b6635b6f86f86ec21d534.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2412.04&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fd09901147a6d021896df6b47340b2c04330fbecb.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F2353b213d0de78bc59d7af8d098331812e8a0019.bin" name="wistia_ugs3g2vurn_html" style="display:block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="opaque"></embed></object><noscript itemprop="description"><p>The Short Term Small Business Lending panel at LendIt USA 2015 with Steve Alloca, of PayPal; Anton Hanebrink, of Square Capital; Kathryn Petralia, of Kabbage; Jason Rockman, of CAN Capital; Stephen Sheinbaum, of Merchant Cash and Capital; and moderator Brock Black, of Lendio.</p></noscript></div></div>

These asset classes derived from marketplace lending, according to Davis, of Prime Meridian, are not new asset classes. Marketplace lending is just like old school banking.<br><br>Davis also said that third parties like his company give increased liquidity and allow portfolio distribution. This is as opposed to passive investment that might reflect the return of the whole platform.<br><br>Carroll, of Victory Park Capital, said that the competitive edge is that, for some of these companies we control 100% of the volume of certain companies. Moving in size sometimes gets us better deals with the platforms.<br><br>Other questions that were discussed during the panel included:<br>&bull; How do you screen platforms?<br>&bull; How do you present this asset class?<br>&bull; What about yield compression?', track: 'Main', slug: 'asset-allocation', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/bba37790ab5d705e17687219907ef7cc361c5c45.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_svvl6uws8f" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="LendIt USA 2015: Asset Allocation: Where Does the Asset Class Fit?" /><meta itemprop="duration" content="PT43M18S" /><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/bba37790ab5d705e17687219907ef7cc361c5c45.bin" /><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/3df4ec76d5e7f30dbc694cdc2ee5d91df5c22164.bin" /><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27&autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=857135381&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbd2a168f0a8357ecfc8be1cd1ce8c1e458f89746.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2598.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbba37790ab5d705e17687219907ef7cc361c5c45.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F3df4ec76d5e7f30dbc694cdc2ee5d91df5c22164.bin" /><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2015-05-07T19:33:08Z" /><object id="wistia_svvl6uws8f_seo" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" style="display:block;height:546px;position:relative;width:970px;"><param name="movie" value="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=857135381&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbd2a168f0a8357ecfc8be1cd1ce8c1e458f89746.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2598.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbba37790ab5d705e17687219907ef7cc361c5c45.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F3df4ec76d5e7f30dbc694cdc2ee5d91df5c22164.bin"></param><embed src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor=#000000 flashvars="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=857135381&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbd2a168f0a8357ecfc8be1cd1ce8c1e458f89746.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=2598.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fbba37790ab5d705e17687219907ef7cc361c5c45.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F3df4ec76d5e7f30dbc694cdc2ee5d91df5c22164.bin" name="wistia_svvl6uws8f_html" style="display:block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="opaque"></embed></object><noscript itemprop="description"><p>Asset Allocation: Where Does the Asset Class Fit? panel at LendIt USA 2015, with Brian Stern, Managing Director of BlackRock; Don Davis, Managing Partner of Prime Meridian; Brendan Carroll, Partner of Victory Park Capital; Tom Goila, Senior Managing Director of Aequitas; Andrew Hallowell, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Arcadia Funds; James Viceconte, Portfolio Manager of AllianceBernstein; and moderator James Alexander, Co-Founder of Alternative Capital Associates.</p></noscript></div></div>

growthsecusa15 = Video.create(title: 'The Growth of Securitization', description: 'The Growth of Securitization panel at LendIt USA 2015 with Nino Fanlo, CFO & COO of SoFi; Zhengyuan Lu, SVP Capital Markets of OnDeck; Larry Chiavaro, Executive Vice President, Principal of First Associates; Ram Ahluwalia, CEO & Co-Founder of PeerIQ; Stephanie Yeh, Director, Investment Bank Division of Credit Suisse; William Black, Managing Director of Moody\'s; and moderator John Bunting, Managing Director of Garrison.<br><br>Securitization is scalable, brings discipline, recognition and can be tailored for buyers and lenders with different risk and time profiles. This, along with the hedging would help draw longer term institutional investors that can help drive the growth for online lending platforms. The securitization market is primed to grow. Rated transactions with 30 to 40 investors and other connections and integrations with the ABS market are getting more sophisticated and ubiquitous according to Stephanie Yeh of Credit Suisse.<br><br>Zhengyuan Lu mentioned that securitization is scalable and can be the funding for our growing origination. Stephanie Yeh also praises the validation securitization brings is important. Nino Fanlo believes this validation stems at least partially from the discipline securitization forces. Discipline reduces capital cost and increases the capital base. The discipline it offers is integral in improving your process.<br><br>Securitization is also way to create leverage and the more long term investors like bank and institutional investors get involved, the more they will seek these tools. According to Ram Ahluwalia, hedging instruments in general will grow because institutional investors are required to hold assets for 3-5 years and these assets are relatively illiquid. That period may extend through a credit cycle that leaves institutional investors overexposed.<br><br>Securitization is also attractive because it can be tailored. It lets a hedge fund buy one type of risk and another for an insurance company. It allows people to buy the risk they want according to Nino Fanlo.<br><br>Whether or not the online marketplace lending is a new origination channel or a new asset class, innovative tech and scrupulous transparency are integral to the success of participants in the field thinks Ram Ahluwalia. There are many risks, as the moderator pointed out. Ideally one should seek securitization and diversification of both funding and buyers.<br><br>William Black from Moody’s big concerns are data, history and plumbing.<br><br>Data: While it is the greatest strength of marketplace lenders, especially when coupled with their transparency. Black\'s concern is primarily one of quality, both of the models these companies make and the data they plug into these models.<br><br>History: Mr. Black believes this is the biggest weakness of these marketplaces. These companies, their partners and models are relatively untested.<br><br>The plumbing (e.g. the cash flow, cash allocations servicing etc): For example, startups often fail. Ratings agencies need to know: Is someone capable of stepping in should the originator go out of business? We don’t know what will happen if one of these companies goes under. Since we are rating securities, divorced from the credit of the originators, we, the rating agencies need to see if the obligations will still pay if these startups fail.<br><br>Ram Ahluwhalia thinks that there is a wedge between the regulatory capital of banks and the often institutional capital market lending platforms are so good at collecting. Securitization is integral in putting both types of capital to work on these platforms.

Thanks to technology, borrowers will have access to 500 billion of loans over the next few years. Sasha was very excited that technology is improving access to data and lowering the cost of that access. He believes that the traditional credit bureau works very well, but In today\'s regulatory environment underwriting is far more exciting than ever before. You have the ability to separate prime more effectively and we are just at the cusp of when it becomes very exciting.<br><br>Angela explained the challenge in underwriting for banks being getting money to borrowers as soon as possible, but making sure the underwriting is sound. It is very hard to credit check small businesses because there isn\'t a credit bureau infrastructure for them like there is for individuals. She finds it interesting how Kabbage has been able to leverage the data that is out there and is verified. She used the example of a seller on Amazon marketplace and how that will lead to a great deal of data on sales and revenue. This data is harder for banks to access because it takes time, but smaller platforms can use this, especially for small businesses, which are the most interesting loan products because they have more data they can leverage. Basically this has the consequence that that there is more credit out there and that is great because credit is required in order for an economy to grow.<br><br>Jeff was asked, "How do the big credit agencies view this new data?". He answered that ultimately everything comes back to the 3 C\'s: Credit, collateral and capacity. He conceded that as the industry continues to evolve, we have to evolve with it and that means that new data sources are opening up.<br><br>Sasha brought up the subject of possible bank partnerships, explaining that LendUp deals with deep subprime customers with a high success rate and banks will have to face up to partnerships where they can not originate and process loans as effectively. Angela agreed, commenting on the banks offering up of one vanilla product to all when there are firms now whose focus is creating the right borrower experience.<br><br>Louis ended the session by discussing a trend toward personalization in lending. He explained Earnest\'s ability to find people that are just the right fit and to evaluate every person on an individual basis. He commented on the irony that we started lending in a very personal world (one to one meetings with a local bank manager). Having departed from it due to automation, it is now this very automation of processes that are now allowing us to return to it and make the decisions finer and finer depending on your unique situation.', track: 'Track 2', slug: 'trends-in-credit-underwriting', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/f533f0872200af16574e2ce5082f392305d2895a.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_phjr2fgmcp" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="LendIt USA 2015: Trends in Credit Underwriting" /><meta itemprop="duration" content="PT27M44S" /><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/f533f0872200af16574e2ce5082f392305d2895a.bin" /><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/96677eb7088bbb42c7a2b9c73dad7ba00f4c78ac.bin" /><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27&autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=548946851&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fe60ff346a4ddf464534cd1cdefd77e38b54fd454.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1664.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Ff533f0872200af16574e2ce5082f392305d2895a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F96677eb7088bbb42c7a2b9c73dad7ba00f4c78ac.bin" /><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2015-05-25T05:50:29Z" /><object id="wistia_phjr2fgmcp_seo" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" style="display:block;height:546px;position:relative;width:970px;"><param name="movie" value="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=548946851&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fe60ff346a4ddf464534cd1cdefd77e38b54fd454.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1664.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Ff533f0872200af16574e2ce5082f392305d2895a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F96677eb7088bbb42c7a2b9c73dad7ba00f4c78ac.bin"></param><embed src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor=#000000 flashvars="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=548946851&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fe60ff346a4ddf464534cd1cdefd77e38b54fd454.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1664.56&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Ff533f0872200af16574e2ce5082f392305d2895a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F96677eb7088bbb42c7a2b9c73dad7ba00f4c78ac.bin" name="wistia_phjr2fgmcp_html" style="display:block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="opaque"></embed></object><noscript itemprop="description"><p>Trends In Credit Underwriting panel at LendIt USA 2015 with Jeff Knott, of Equifax; Angela Ceresnie, of Orchard; Sasha Orloff, of LendUp; Tim Van Tassel, of FICO; Louis Beryl, of Earnest; and moderator John Hecht, of Jefferies.</p><p>In marketplace lending the pace has increased.

Toms, of Freedom Financial Asset Management; and moderator James Gutierrez, Insikt & Opportun.<br><br>Each of these companies focused on a slightly different part of the near prime, subprime or underbanked market. Whereas Freedom Financial, Avant and Zest Finance focus on the lending element, Citi focuses on securitization and National Debt Relief helps borrowers resolve their debt.<br><br>The panelists agreed on a few key points. Firstly, subprime borrowers proved to be more recession proof during the recent recession than prime borrowers.

Whereas Freedom Financial, Avant and Zest Finance focus on the lending element, Citi focuses on securitization and National Debt Relief helps borrowers resolve their debt.</p><p>The panelists agreed on a few key points. Firstly, subprime borrowers proved to be more recession proof during the recent recession than prime borrowers. Secondly, the middle FICO score borrowers (in the 600-680 range) are perhaps the hardest people to underwrite, and thus present the greatest opportunity. Thirdly, this industry focuses on big data, but the reality is there actually isn’t that much data. Rather, the important differentiating factor is machine learning and building superior algorithms.

The biggest challenges in shifting from retail to institutional investors include access to institutional quality deal flow, the speed of educating investors in the space, and slow release of regulatory changes. The panelists generally thought that the bidding model doesn’t work for real estate because real estate is not as homogenous of a product as consumer loans or small business loans. In terms of reaching scale, the key will lie not just in winning institutional capital, but also being able to go through a down cycle. The market isn’t large enough for secondary transactions, but there will be one in 12 months. The panelists also expressed their collective goal in helping to make real estate investment available to all investor types and allowing every qualified borrower to get access to capital.', track: 'Real Estate', slug: 'platforms-shifting-from-retail-to-institutional-investors', conference_id: usa15.id, img: 'https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/80acd5aa37e017422ca54d95446f09978e608f7a.bin', embed: '<div id="wistia_hixsb0nw5j" class="wistia_embed" style="width:970px;height:574px;"><div itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="name" content="Lendit USA 2015: Platforms Shifting from Retail to Institutional Investors" /><meta itemprop="duration" content="PT30M20S" /><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/80acd5aa37e017422ca54d95446f09978e608f7a.bin" /><meta itemprop="contentURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b33ddee7e76bc3710455bf7ea4e3f374a6166c8f.bin" /><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27&autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=600291297&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F76acdf2325a3fe47ddb1a7596e89f0ef1b44b53d.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1820.26&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F80acd5aa37e017422ca54d95446f09978e608f7a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb33ddee7e76bc3710455bf7ea4e3f374a6166c8f.bin" /><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2015-05-26T04:20:23Z" /><object id="wistia_hixsb0nw5j_seo" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" style="display:block;height:546px;position:relative;width:970px;"><param name="movie" value="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="wmode" value="opaque"></param><param name="flashvars" value="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=600291297&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F76acdf2325a3fe47ddb1a7596e89f0ef1b44b53d.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1820.26&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F80acd5aa37e017422ca54d95446f09978e608f7a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb33ddee7e76bc3710455bf7ea4e3f374a6166c8f.bin"></param><embed src="https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/flash/embed_player_v2.0.swf?2015-02-27" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor=#000000 flashvars="autoPlay=false&banner=false&controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&customColor=7b796a&endVideoBehavior=default&fullscreenDisabled=true&hdUrl%5B2pass%5D=true&hdUrl%5Bext%5D=flv&hdUrl%5Bheight%5D=720&hdUrl%5Bsize%5D=600291297&hdUrl%5Btype%5D=hdflv&hdUrl%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F76acdf2325a3fe47ddb1a7596e89f0ef1b44b53d.bin&hdUrl%5Bwidth%5D=1280&mediaDuration=1820.26&playButtonVisible=true&showPlayButton=true&showPlaybar=true&showVolume=true&stillUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F80acd5aa37e017422ca54d95446f09978e608f7a.bin%3Fimage_crop_resized%3D970x546&unbufferedSeek=false&videoUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fembed-ssl.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2Fb33ddee7e76bc3710455bf7ea4e3f374a6166c8f.bin" name="wistia_hixsb0nw5j_html" style="display:block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="opaque"></embed></object><noscript itemprop="description"><p>Platforms Shifting from Retail to Institutional Investors with Chris Ganan, Co-Founder &amp; President of AssetAvenue; William Skelley, Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO of iFunding; James Herbert, Co-Founder &amp; President of LendingHome; Dan Miller, Co-Founder &amp; President of Fundrise; Jilliene Helman, Founder &amp; CEO of RealtyMogul; and moderator Ethan Penner, Professor at USC Marshall School of Business.</p></noscript></div></div>

There were some aspects on which they agreed, such as that mortgage shopping must move online.

They are a short-term real estate debt lending business in the U.K. The U.K. mortgage market is $325 Billion, compared to $1.2 Trillion for the U.S. In the U.K., mortgage lending in 2014 was less than half the volume compared to 2007, the average mortgage takes three months from application to draw down, and the entire mortgage process is offline.

Bill from Plum Lending confessed that for him the appeal came from the absence of regulation. Whereas the customers in residential real estate are individuals who are assumed to be ignorant and to need protection, the customers buying commercial real estate are wealthy individuals who are assumed to be intelligent, knowledgeable and to have a team of advisors available. This means that there are deals that can be made more quickly with a lower cost.<br><br>Joanna from EarlyShares explained her passion for commercial real estate crowdfunding as being a way to "create entrepreneurs" from investors.

Whereas the customers in residential real estate are individuals who are assumed to be ignorant and to need protection, the customers buying commercial real estate are wealthy individuals who are assumed to be intelligent, knowledgeable and to have a team of advisors available. This means that there are deals that can be made more quickly with a lower cost.</p><p>Joanna from EarlyShares explained her passion for commercial real estate crowdfunding as being a way to "create entrepreneurs" from investors.
