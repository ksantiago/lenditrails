The success of peer-to-peer feels inevitable, the internet is breaking down all sorts of barriers and now it has given us an opportunity to change the way people interact with the banking system the decision to use peer-to-peer finance has become an easy one to make for those who take the time to consider it.\" Peter sits on the Board of RateSetter.")
