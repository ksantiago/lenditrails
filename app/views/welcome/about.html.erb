    <h2>LENDIT HISTORY</h2>

Our 2nd annual conference, on May 4-6, 2014 in San Francisco, grew to more than twice the size of the inaugural event, and was even more well-received by industry participants. As the online lending industry continues to proliferate, LendIt is expanding internationally -- in Shanghai and London.
