						<p class="intro">LendIt Europe will be Europe’s largest gathering ever for the peer-to-peer lending industry with over 400 people expected to attend. It will include a powerful lineup of keynote presentations delivered by European peer to peer lending industry leaders, interactive panel discussions, extensive networking as well as an exhibit hall consisting of leading and emerging online lending portals, infrastructure companies and service providers focused on the peer-to-peer and online lending industry.</p>

						<p class="secondary">LendIt Europe will be held at a state of the art venue in the heart of London’s financial district. 155 Bishopsgate is conveniently located next to Liverpool St. Station and just 200 yards from the Andaz Hotel on Liverpool St where we have a discounted room block. There will also be a cocktail party (for an additional cost) on Sunday night, November 16 at the Andaz Hotel.</p>
