			<p class="intro">LendIt will be returning to China in 2015 but this time we are organizing a 7 day tour through Beijing and Shanghai to meet the top P2P companies, institutional investors, and Chinese government officials.	We will arrange company visits, host dinner parties, arrange private meetings, and we will co-host two major conferences, one in Beijing and one in Shanghai.	If you want to do business with China, it is about building long term relationships, which is exactly what we help to facilitate with LendIt China.</p>

				"Marketplace lending is arguably the hottest spot for financial innovation today and LendIt is right at its center, stoking the fires with great education, content, and networking. LendIt assembles all the key players, asks all the right questions, and creates the perfect forum to fire up ideas, spark connections, and facilitate deal making."
